# Common-People-Names

**Common-People-Names** is a lightweight, zero-dependency npm package providing a high-fidelity database of the most frequent given names globally. It is designed to be a reliable source of truth for real-world naming conventions across different cultures and nations.

## Core Features

* **Frequency-Driven:** Unlike popularity lists that focus on current baby name trends, this library provides names based on the highest total population frequency. This ensures the data reflects the actual names you are most likely to encounter in each country today.
* **Gender-Specific Validation:** Manual curation ensures names are assigned to the correct gender categories according to local cultural norms (e.g., identifying **Andrea** as a top male name in Italy).
* **Linguistic Integrity:** Full support for **UTF-8** character sets, ensuring all regional diacritics and special characters (e.g., **ð**, **á**, **ñ**) are preserved for maximum authenticity.
* **Clean Dataset:** Every entry is manually verified and stripped of surnames, religious honorifics (such as Haji or Seyyed), and occupational titles that often contaminate raw demographic lists.

## What is it for?

This library is a dedicated tool for developers, researchers, and designers who require authentic, localized name data for various applications:

* **Generating Realistic Mock Data:** Perfect for seeding databases with user profiles that feel authentic to their specified country of origin.
* **Localization and Internationalization:** Provides a foundation for understanding common names when adapting products for specific global markets.
* **Persona Creation:** Helps UX researchers and writers build realistic user personas that align with the demographic reality of different regions.
* **Demographic Modeling:** Useful for data science projects where representative name samples are needed for simulation or analysis.
